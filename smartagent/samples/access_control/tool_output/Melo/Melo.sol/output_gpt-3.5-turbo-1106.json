```
constructor
The constructor function does not have any access control modifier, which means anyone can call it to initialize the contract. This can be a potential access control bug.

mint
The `mint` function is marked as public, which means anyone can call it to mint tokens. This can be a potential access control bug if minting should be restricted to certain roles.

increaseAllowance
The `increaseAllowance` function is marked as public, which means anyone can increase the allowance. This can be a potential access control bug if allowance modification should be restricted to certain roles.

decreaseAllowance
The `decreaseAllowance` function is marked as public, which means anyone can decrease the allowance. This can be a potential access control bug if allowance modification should be restricted to certain roles.
