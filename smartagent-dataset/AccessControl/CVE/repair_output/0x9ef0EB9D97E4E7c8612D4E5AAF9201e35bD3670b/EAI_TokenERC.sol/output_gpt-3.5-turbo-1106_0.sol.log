{"detector_output": "1. The constructor function `EAI_TokenERC` is not marked as `constructor`, which means it can be called by anyone to initialize the contract. This is an access control bug as it should only be called once by the contract creator.\n\n2. The `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions do not have any access control modifiers, which means anyone can call these functions to transfer tokens. This is a potential access control bug as only the owner or authorized users should be able to transfer tokens.\n\n3. The `burn` and `burnFrom` functions also do not have any access control modifiers, which means anyone can call these functions to burn tokens. This is a potential access control bug as only the owner or authorized users should be able to burn tokens.\n\n4. There is no access control for the `totalSupply` variable, which means anyone can modify the total supply of the token. This is a potential access control bug as only the owner or authorized users should be able to modify the total supply.\n\nIn conclusion, the provided code has several access control bugs related to the initialization of the contract, transfer of tokens, and burning of tokens. These bugs could potentially allow unauthorized users to perform critical actions on the smart contract.", "analyzer_chain": "EAI_TokenERC\nThe constructor function `EAI_TokenERC` is not marked as `constructor`, which means it can be called by anyone to initialize the contract.\n\ntransfer and transferFrom\nThe `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions do not have any access control modifiers, which means anyone can call these functions to transfer tokens.\n\nburn and burnFrom\nThe `burn` and `burnFrom` functions also do not have any access control modifiers, which means anyone can call these functions to burn tokens.\n\ntotalSupply\nThere is no access control for the `totalSupply` variable, which means anyone can modify the total supply of the token."}
