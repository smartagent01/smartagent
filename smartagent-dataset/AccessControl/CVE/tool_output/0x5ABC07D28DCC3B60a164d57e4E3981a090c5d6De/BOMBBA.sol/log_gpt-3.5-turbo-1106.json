{"detector_output": "1. The `Ownable` contract has a modifier `onlyOwner` which restricts certain functions to be called only by the owner. This is a good access control measure.\n\n2. The `transferOwnership` function allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a new owner. This function also has the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the current owner can transfer ownership.\n\n3. The `BOMBBA` contract inherits from `ERC20Interface` and `Ownable`, which means it also inherits the access control measures from the `Ownable` contract.\n\n4. The `quaker` function sets the `owner` and `ownerWallet` variables, but it does not have the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means that anyone can call this function and potentially change the owner and ownerWallet, which is a potential access control bug.\n\n5. The `mint` and `pullBack` functions have the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring that only the owner can mint or pull back tokens, which is a good access control measure.\n\n6. The `showMyTokenBalance` function does not have any access control measures, meaning anyone can call this function to view the token balance of any address, which is a potential access control bug.\n\nIn conclusion, the code has some access control bugs, specifically in the `quaker` and `showMyTokenBalance` functions. These functions should have access control measures to ensure that only authorized users can call them.", "analyzer_chain": "quaker\nThis function sets the owner and ownerWallet variables without the onlyOwner modifier, allowing anyone to potentially change the owner and ownerWallet.\n\nshowMyTokenBalance\nThis function does not have any access control measures, allowing anyone to call it to view the token balance of any address."}
