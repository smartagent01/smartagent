UBSexToken
The constructor for the `BAFCToken` contract is incorrectly named `UBSexToken`, allowing public reinitialization.

approve
The `approve` function does not check if the contract is `transferable`, potentially allowing approvals that cannot be executed.

transfer
The `transfer` function does not check if the `msg.sender` account is frozen, allowing a frozen account to transfer tokens.

transferOwnership
The `transferOwnership` function does not emit an event when ownership is changed, lacking transparency for critical state changes.

switchLiquidity
The `switchLiquidity` function does not emit an event when liquidity is switched, lacking transparency for critical state changes.
