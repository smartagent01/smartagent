owned
The `owned` function is incorrectly named and should be the constructor, allowing anyone to call it and change the owner after deployment.

mintToken
The `mintToken` function has no cap on the minting amount, potentially leading to an unlimited supply of tokens.

RobotBTC
The `RobotBTC` contract does not call the `owned` constructor, possibly resulting in the owner being the zero address.

buy
The `buy` function does not check for overflows when calculating the `amount` of tokens to transfer.

sell
The `sell` function does not check that the caller has enough tokens before attempting to transfer ether to them.
