{"detector_output": "1. The contract has an Ownable contract that implements access control through the onlyOwner modifier. This ensures that certain functions can only be called by the owner of the contract.\n\n2. The createNode function allows users to create nodes, but it does not have any access control checks. This means that anyone can call this function and create nodes, which is a potential access control bug.\n\n3. The claimNodeReward and claimAllNodesReward functions also do not have any access control checks. This means that anyone can claim rewards for nodes, which is a potential access control bug.\n\n4. The getRewardTotalAmountOf and getRewardAmountOf functions also do not have any access control checks. This means that anyone can query the reward amounts for nodes, which is a potential access control bug.\n\n5. The changeNodePrice and changeRewardPerNode functions do not have access control checks. This means that anyone can change the node price and reward per node, which is a potential access control bug.\n\n6. The setTeamWallet, setTeamFees, and setMaxNodes functions also do not have access control checks. This means that anyone can change the team wallet, team fees, and maximum nodes, which is a potential access control bug.\n\nIn conclusion, the code has several access control bugs as mentioned above. These bugs can allow unauthorized users to create nodes, claim rewards, change parameters, and perform other critical actions on the smart contract. It is important to implement proper access control checks in these functions to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security of the smart contract.", "analyzer_chain": "```\ncreateNode\nThe createNode function allows anyone to create nodes without access control checks.\n\nclaimNodeReward\nThe claimNodeReward function allows anyone to claim rewards for nodes without access control checks.\n\nclaimAllNodesReward\nThe claimAllNodesReward function allows anyone to claim rewards for all nodes without access control checks.\n\ngetRewardTotalAmountOf\nThe getRewardTotalAmountOf function allows anyone to query the total reward amount without access control checks.\n\ngetRewardAmountOf\nThe getRewardAmountOf function allows anyone to query the reward amount for a specific node without access control checks.\n\nchangeNodePrice\nThe changeNodePrice function allows anyone to change the node price without access control checks.\n\nchangeRewardPerNode\nThe changeRewardPerNode function allows anyone to change the reward per node without access control checks.\n\nsetTeamWallet\nThe setTeamWallet function allows anyone to change the team wallet without access control checks.\n\nsetTeamFees\nThe setTeamFees function allows anyone to change the team fees without access control checks.\n\nsetMaxNodes\nThe setMaxNodes function allows anyone to change the maximum nodes without access control checks.\n```"}
