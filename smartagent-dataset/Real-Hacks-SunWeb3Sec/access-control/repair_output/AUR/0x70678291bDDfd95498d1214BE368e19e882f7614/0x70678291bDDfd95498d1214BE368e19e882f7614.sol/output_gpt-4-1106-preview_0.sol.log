{"detector_output": "Upon reviewing the provided smart contract code, I will highlight potential access control vulnerabilities based on the common bug patterns described and my own analysis:\n\n1. **Incorrect constructor name or initialize function that is public**: The constructors for `Ownable` and `AurumNodePool` are correctly named and are not public functions that can be called again after deployment. There is no `initialize` function present, which is common in upgradeable contracts. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\n2. **Incorrect implementation of access control modifier**: The `onlyOwner` modifier is correctly implemented in the `Ownable` contract and is used in functions that require owner permissions, such as `changeRewardPerNode`, `setTeamWallet`, `setTeamFees`, and `setMaxNodes`. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\n3. **Missing permission checking in functions that can change the ownership or admin right of the contract**: The `transferOwnership` function correctly checks for owner permissions using the `onlyOwner` modifier. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\n4. **Allow anyone to self destruct, withdraw ether, or withdraw token from the contract**: There is no self-destruct functionality, and there are no functions that allow arbitrary withdrawal of ether or tokens by unauthorized users. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\n5. **Allow anyone to burn, transfer token belong to other users or minting unlimited amount of token**: The contract does not contain burn or mint functions, and the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions of the `IERC20` interface are not overridden in a way that would allow unauthorized transfers. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\n6. **Allow anyone to delegate call to their controlled contract**: The `Address` library contains a `functionDelegateCall` function, but it is not used in the `AurumNodePool` contract. Moreover, it is an internal function, so it cannot be called by external entities. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\n7. **Allow anyone to perform external call to arbitrary contract**: The `Address` library contains functions for performing external calls (`functionCall`, `functionCallWithValue`, etc.), but these are internal and are not used in the `AurumNodePool` contract. This pattern does not seem to be violated.\n\nHowever, there are a few concerns that are not directly related to the common patterns but are worth mentioning:\n\n- The `changeNodePrice` function does not have an `onlyOwner` modifier, which means any user can change the node price. This is a critical vulnerability as it allows anyone to manipulate the economics of the contract.\n- The `createNode` function transfers the `operationsPrice` to the `teamWallet` without checking if the `teamWallet` is a valid address (non-zero). This could potentially lead to loss of funds if the `teamWallet` is set to the zero address.\n- The `binary_search` function is marked as `view`, but it should be `pure` since it does not read from the contract's state.\n- The `claimNodeReward` and `claimAllNodesReward` functions do not check if the `rewardNode` or `rewardsTotal` is greater than zero before attempting a transfer, which could lead to unnecessary gas usage in case of zero rewards.\n\nIn conclusion, the contract does not exhibit the common access control vulnerabilities as described, but it does contain a critical vulnerability in the `changeNodePrice` function and a few other concerns that should be addressed.", "analyzer_chain": "changeNodePrice\nAny user can change the node price due to the lack of an `onlyOwner` modifier."}
