No buggy functions can be identified from the provided text. The text is a general description of what to look for in a smart contract to find access control bugs, but it does not contain specific function implementations or code snippets that can be analyzed for vulnerabilities. To identify buggy functions, the actual source code of the `BancorNetwork` contract and related contracts would be needed.
