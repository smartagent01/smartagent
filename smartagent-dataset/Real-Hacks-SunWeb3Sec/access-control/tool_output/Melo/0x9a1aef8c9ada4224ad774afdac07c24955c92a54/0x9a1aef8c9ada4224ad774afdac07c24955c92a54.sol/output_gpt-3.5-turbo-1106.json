```
constructor
The constructor function does not have any access control modifier, which means anyone can call it to initialize the contract.

mint
The `mint` function does not have any access control modifier, allowing anyone to mint an unlimited amount of tokens.

transferFrom
The `transferFrom` function does not have proper permission checking, as it allows the caller to transfer tokens without checking if they have the necessary allowance.

approve, increaseAllowance, decreaseAllowance
The `approve`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance` functions also do not have any access control modifier, allowing anyone to modify the allowance for any address.
