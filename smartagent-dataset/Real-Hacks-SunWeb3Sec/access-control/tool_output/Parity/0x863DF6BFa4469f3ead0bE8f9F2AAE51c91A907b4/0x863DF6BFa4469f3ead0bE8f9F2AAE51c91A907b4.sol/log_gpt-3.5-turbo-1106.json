{"detector_output": "1. The contract uses a modifier called onlyowner to restrict access to certain functions. This is a good practice for access control.\n\n2. The contract also uses a modifier called onlymanyowners to require multiple owners to confirm an operation before it is executed. This is another good practice for access control.\n\n3. The contract has functions to add, remove, and change owners, as well as to change the required number of confirmations. These functions are important for managing access control.\n\n4. The contract has a function to execute transactions, which checks if the sender is an owner and if the transaction is under the daily limit. This is a good practice for access control.\n\n5. The contract has a function to confirm a transaction, which requires multiple owners to confirm before the transaction is executed. This is another good practice for access control.\n\nBased on the analysis, the code does not seem to have any access control bugs. The use of modifiers, multiple owner confirmations, and functions to manage owners and confirmations indicate that the contract is designed with access control in mind.", "analyzer_chain": "addOwner\nMissing permission checking in functions that can change the ownership or admin right of the contract.\n\nremoveOwner\nMissing permission checking in functions that can change the ownership or admin right of the contract.\n\nchangeConfirmations\nMissing permission checking in functions that can change the ownership or admin right of the contract.\n\nexecuteTransaction\nThe function checks if the sender is an owner and if the transaction is under the daily limit, which is a good practice for access control.\n\nconfirmTransaction\nThe function requires multiple owners to confirm before the transaction is executed, which is a good practice for access control."}
