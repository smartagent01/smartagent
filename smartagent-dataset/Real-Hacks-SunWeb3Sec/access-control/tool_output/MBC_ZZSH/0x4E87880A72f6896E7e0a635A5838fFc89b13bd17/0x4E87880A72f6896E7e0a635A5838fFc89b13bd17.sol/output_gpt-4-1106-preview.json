rescueToken
The `rescueToken` function allows the `_tokenOwner` to transfer any ERC20 token from the contract, which could be a potential risk.

swapTokensForOther
The `swapTokensForOther` function is public and could be manipulated for front-running or other exploits.

swapAndLiquify
The `swapAndLiquify` function is public and could be a potential issue if not designed to be called by anyone.

swapAndLiquifyStepv1
The `swapAndLiquifyStepv1` function is public and could be a potential issue if not designed to be called by anyone.

transferFromm
The `transferFromm` function is public, does not have the `onlyOwner` modifier, and could be a critical vulnerability.

_transferrToken
The `_transferrToken` function does not emit a `Transfer` event, violating the ERC20 standard and potentially leading to inaccurate balance tracking.
