{"detector_output": "1. The contract has a constructor that sets the initial owner and initializes the token with a total supply.\n2. The contract has a function to update the Uniswap V2 Router address, which can only be called by the owner.\n3. The contract has a function to exclude an account from fees, which can only be called by the owner.\n4. The contract has a function to set the swap tokens at amount, which can only be called by the owner.\n5. The contract has a function to change the distribution status, which can only be called by the owner.\n6.

The contract has a function to add tokens to the Warp contract, which can only be called by the owner.\n8. The contract has a function to change the swap stats, which can only be called by the owner.\n9. The contract has a function to set the swap and liquify enabled status, which can only be called by the owner.\n10. The contract has a function to transfer tokens, which includes logic to handle fees and swapping for liquidity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the code does not contain any access control bugs related to unauthorized access to critical functions or actions. The access control mechanisms are properly implemented, and the critical functions can only be called by the owner. Therefore, the code appears to be secure in terms of access control and permission-related vulnerabilities.", "analyzer_chain": "The contract has a constructor that sets the initial owner and initializes the token with a total supply.\n- The constructor should not be public, as it allows anyone to call it to initialize the contract.\n\nThe contract has a function to transfer tokens, which includes logic to handle fees and swapping for liquidity.\n- The function should include permission checking to ensure only authorized users can transfer tokens."}
